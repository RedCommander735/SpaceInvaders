# Space Invaders

A simple space invaders project done in bevy for my computer science course

Compiled binarys for windows can be found [here](/releases/latest) or if you want to run or build it yourself from source you can either do  


```
cargo run
```
or  

```
cargo build --release
```

be sure to always have a copy of the asset folder in the same directory as your executable so it can find all assets.
